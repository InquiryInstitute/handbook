<div class="page"><h1>4. Teaching at Inquiry Institute</h1>

<h2>What Constitutes a "Course"</h2>

<p>A course at Inquiry Institute is a structured engagement with a domain of knowledge, designed to facilitate learning and inquiry. It is not merely a collection of lectures, nor is it simply a syllabus. It is a living thing, an ongoing conversation, a shared exploration.</p>

<p>Courses may take many forms. They may be formal, with scheduled sessions and assessments. They may be informal, with open-ended exploration and dialogue. They may be short, focused intensives, or they may be long, comprehensive explorations.</p>

<p>What matters is not the form, but the function: does it facilitate learning? Does it engage pupils in meaningful inquiry? Does it contribute to the Institute's mission?</p>

<h2>Formats</h2>

<p>The Institute recognizes several course formats, each with its own strengths and purposes.</p>

<strong>Lectures</strong> are structured presentations where you share knowledge, present arguments, explore ideas. They are not monologues—even in lectures, dialogue and questions are encouraged. But they are primarily one-directional, with you as the primary voice.

<strong>Dialogues</strong> are structured conversations between you and pupils, or between multiple faculty and pupils. They are collaborative explorations, where knowledge emerges through conversation rather than transmission.

<strong>Socratic Interrogations</strong> are question-driven explorations, where you guide pupils through inquiry by asking questions rather than providing answers. They require patience and skill, but they can be particularly effective for developing critical thinking.

<strong>Laboratories</strong> are hands-on explorations, where pupils engage directly with materials, processes, or ideas. They may be physical or virtual, but they emphasize direct engagement over passive reception.

<strong>Studios</strong> are creative spaces, where pupils create, experiment, explore. They emphasize process over product, exploration over completion.

<p>You may use any of these formats, or combinations of them. The Institute values diversity in teaching approaches.</p>

<h2>K–PhD Continuum Expectations</h2>

<p>The Institute serves learners across a wide range of levels, from kindergarten through PhD and beyond. Your courses should be appropriate to the level of your pupils, but the Institute also encourages cross-level engagement.</p>

<strong>K–12 pupils</strong> need structure, clarity, and engagement. They benefit from concrete examples, clear explanations, and active participation. But they should not be condescended to—they are capable of sophisticated thinking when appropriately supported.

<strong>Undergraduate pupils</strong> need both structure and freedom. They benefit from clear frameworks while also being given space to explore. They are developing their own voices and should be supported in that development.

<strong>Graduate pupils</strong> need depth, rigor, and independence. They benefit from challenging material, critical engagement, and opportunities for original work. They are developing expertise and should be treated as emerging colleagues.

<strong>PhD and beyond</strong> pupils need collaboration, challenge, and intellectual freedom. They benefit from being treated as peers, engaged in genuine dialogue, and given opportunities to contribute to knowledge.

<p>The Institute encourages courses that engage multiple levels, where advanced pupils can mentor beginners, and beginners can bring fresh perspectives to advanced work.</p>

<h2>Seasonal / Cyclical Teaching</h2>

<p>The Institute operates on seasonal cycles, and many courses align with these cycles. You may teach courses that run for a month, a season, a year, or longer.</p>

<strong>Monthly courses</strong> are intensive, focused explorations of specific topics. They allow for deep engagement with limited scope.

<strong>Seasonal courses</strong> align with the Institute's seasonal observances—Candlemas, Beltane, Solstice, and others. They may incorporate ritual and ceremony alongside scholarly content.

<strong>Yearly courses</strong> are comprehensive explorations that develop over time. They allow for sustained engagement and deep development.

<strong>Cyclical courses</strong> repeat on a schedule, allowing pupils to join at different points in the cycle. They accommodate the asynchronous nature of the Institute's community.

<p>You may teach courses on any schedule that makes sense for your content and your pupils. The Institute values both structure and flexibility.</p>
