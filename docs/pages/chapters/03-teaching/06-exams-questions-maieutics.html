<h2>How to Ask Questions That Teach</h2>

<p>Not all questions are created equal. Some questions test recall. Some questions probe understanding. Some questions open inquiry. The Institute values questions that open inquiry.</p>

<strong>Questions that teach</strong> are open-ended, thought-provoking, and generative. They do not have single correct answers. They invite exploration, reflection, and dialogue. They lead to more questions rather than final answers.

<strong>Questions that test</strong> have their place—they can check understanding, identify gaps, provide feedback. But they should not dominate. The Institute values inquiry over interrogation.

<p>When constructing questions, consider: Does this question open inquiry or close it? Does it invite exploration or demand a specific answer? Does it lead to more questions or to a final statement?</p>

<p>The best questions are those that pupils continue to think about long after the course ends.</p>

<h2>When to Answer Directly</h2>

<p>There are times when direct answers are appropriate. When pupils ask for clarification, when they need basic information, when they are stuck on a fundamental point—in these cases, direct answers support learning.</p>

<p>But direct answers should not be the default. The Institute values the process of inquiry, the struggle to understand, the discovery that comes through exploration. Sometimes the best answer is another question.</p>

<p>When pupils ask questions, consider: Would a direct answer support their learning, or would it short-circuit their inquiry? Would it help them understand, or would it prevent them from discovering?</p>

<p>The goal is not to withhold information, but to support genuine understanding. Sometimes that means answering directly. Sometimes it means guiding inquiry.</p>

<h2>When to Refuse to Answer</h2>

<p>There are times when you should refuse to answer, or at least refuse to answer directly. When pupils ask questions that they should explore themselves, when they are seeking shortcuts rather than understanding, when direct answers would prevent discovery—in these cases, refusal supports learning.</p>

<p>This is not about being difficult or withholding information. It is about supporting genuine learning, which requires engagement, struggle, and discovery.</p>

<p>When refusing to answer, explain why. Help pupils understand that the question is worth exploring, that the process matters, that discovery is valuable. Guide them toward resources, methods, or approaches that will help them find their own answers.</p>

<p>The Institute values questions that lead to more questions. Sometimes the best response to a question is to help the pupil ask better questions.</p>

<h2>How to Guide Without Concluding</h2>

<p>The Socratic method—maieutics, the art of midwifery—is about helping pupils give birth to their own understanding. It is not about leading them to predetermined conclusions, but about supporting their own inquiry and discovery.</p>

<strong>Guiding</strong> means asking questions that help pupils think more deeply, providing resources that support exploration, offering perspectives that enrich understanding. It means supporting inquiry without prescribing outcomes.

<strong>Concluding</strong> means providing final answers, closing inquiry, ending exploration. The Institute values open inquiry over closed conclusions.

<p>When guiding pupils, consider: Am I helping them think, or am I telling them what to think? Am I supporting their inquiry, or am I directing it toward a predetermined end? Am I opening possibilities, or am I closing them?</p>

<p>The goal is not to avoid conclusions entirely—understanding requires some conclusions—but to support pupils in reaching their own conclusions through genuine inquiry.</p>
