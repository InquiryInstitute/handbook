<div class="page"><h1>5. Course Construction</h1>

<h2>Learning Arcs vs Syllabi</h2>

<p>Traditional education relies on syllabi—fixed documents that specify what will be covered, when, and how. The Institute recognizes the value of structure, but also the limitations of rigid planning.</p>

<strong>Learning Arcs</strong> are flexible frameworks that guide learning without constraining it. They identify key concepts, essential questions, and desired outcomes, but leave room for exploration, discovery, and adaptation. They are living documents that evolve as the course progresses.

<strong>Syllabi</strong>, when used, should be treated as starting points rather than contracts. They provide structure and clarity, but they should not prevent you from following interesting questions or adapting to your pupils' needs.

<p>The Institute encourages you to think in terms of arcs rather than syllabi. What journey do you want your pupils to take? What questions do you want them to explore? What understanding do you want them to develop? These questions guide arc construction.</p>

<h2>Micro-credentials and Tree of Vines Alignment</h2>

<p>The Institute maintains a "Tree of Vines" system—a structure for recognizing learning achievements through micro-credentials. Your courses should align with this system, identifying which vines pupils can earn through their engagement.</p>

<p>This does not mean your courses must be rigidly structured around credentials. Rather, it means you should be aware of how your course contributes to pupils' broader learning journeys, and how their achievements can be recognized.</p>

<p>The Tree of Vines is organic, growing and evolving. Your courses contribute to that growth, and the system should accommodate your teaching rather than constrain it.</p>

<h2>Required Components</h2>

<p>While the Institute values flexibility, certain components are expected in all courses:</p>

<strong>Core Exposition</strong> is your presentation of essential knowledge, concepts, and perspectives. This is the foundation upon which inquiry builds. It should be clear, accurate, and engaging.

<strong>Questions Worth Asking</strong> are the essential questions that drive inquiry. They should be open-ended, thought-provoking, and generative. They guide exploration without prescribing answers.

<strong>Suggested Readings</strong> are resources that deepen understanding. They may be primary sources, secondary sources, contemporary works, or multimedia. They should be diverse, accessible, and relevant.

<strong>Exercises</strong> are activities that engage pupils actively with the material. They may be mental (reflection, analysis, synthesis), practical (experiments, projects, creations), or creative (artistic expression, imaginative exploration). They should be meaningful, engaging, and appropriately challenging.

<strong>Assessment Philosophy</strong> should be non-punitive and cumulative. Assessment should support learning rather than merely measure it. It should recognize growth, effort, and engagement, not just final products.

<h2>Assessment Philosophy</h2>

<p>The Institute's assessment philosophy emphasizes learning over grading, growth over performance, engagement over completion.</p>

<p>Assessment should be <strong>formative</strong>—providing feedback that supports learning—rather than merely <strong>summative</strong>—measuring final achievement. Pupils should have opportunities to revise, improve, and grow.</p>

<p>Assessment should be <strong>cumulative</strong>—recognizing progress over time—rather than <strong>snapshot</strong>—capturing a single moment. Learning is a process, and assessment should reflect that process.</p>

<p>Assessment should be <strong>non-punitive</strong>—supporting rather than penalizing. Mistakes are opportunities for learning, not failures to be punished. The Institute values effort, engagement, and growth over perfection.</p>

<p>This does not mean assessment is meaningless or that standards are absent. Rather, it means that assessment serves learning rather than sorting, supports growth rather than ranking.</p>
