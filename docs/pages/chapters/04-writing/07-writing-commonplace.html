<div class="page"><h1>7. Writing in the Commonplace</h1>

<h2>What the Commonplace Is</h2>

<p>The Commonplace is the Institute's repository of notes, observations, fragments, and thoughts. It is not a formal publication, nor is it a private journal. It exists in a liminal space: public but informal, structured but flexible, permanent but evolving.</p>

<p>The Commonplace serves multiple functions. It preserves insights that might otherwise be lost. It connects ideas across time and space. It provides a space for thinking in public, for working through ideas, for sharing fragments that are not yet ready for formal publication.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to contribute to the Commonplace. Your notes, observations, and fragments enrich the Institute's collective knowledge.</p>

<h2>Difference Between Formats</h2>

<p>The Institute recognizes several writing formats, each with its own purpose and standards.</p>

<strong>Encyclopaedia Entries</strong> are formal, authoritative, comprehensive. They represent established knowledge, well-researched and carefully documented. They are permanent, or as permanent as anything can be in a living system.

<strong>Commonplace Notes</strong> are informal, exploratory, fragmentary. They capture thoughts in progress, observations, connections. They may be incomplete, speculative, provisional. They are living documents that evolve.

<strong>Inquirer Articles</strong> are scholarly, polished, peer-reviewed. They represent significant contributions to knowledge, well-argued and carefully presented. They are published in the Institute's quarterly journal.

<p>Each format serves a different purpose. Encyclopaedia entries establish knowledge. Commonplace notes explore it. Inquirer articles advance it.</p>

<h2>Style Rules</h2>

<p>The Commonplace values clarity over polish, thought over presentation. Your writing should be clear and engaging, but it need not be perfectly polished. The Commonplace is a space for thinking, not just for finished thoughts.</p>

<p>Write in your own voice. The Commonplace accommodates diverse voices, perspectives, and styles. Your unique perspective is valuable.</p>

<p>Be clear about the status of your thoughts. If you are speculating, say so. If you are uncertain, acknowledge it. If you are working through an idea, make that clear. The Commonplace values honesty about the provisional nature of thought.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Citation Expectations</h2>

<p>Even in informal notes, citations matter. When you reference ideas, sources, or arguments, cite them. This supports transparency, enables verification, and honors the work of others.</p>

<p>Citations need not be formal—a simple reference to a source is often sufficient—but they should be present. The Commonplace values intellectual honesty and transparency.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Marginalia Etiquette</h2>

<p>The Commonplace supports marginalia—notes, comments, connections added by readers. This is a feature, not a bug. Marginalia enrich the Commonplace, connecting ideas, adding perspectives, building on thoughts.</p>

<p>When adding marginalia, be respectful, constructive, and thoughtful. Engage with the ideas, not just the author. Add value, not just commentary.</p>

<hr>

<h2>When Fragments Are Preferable to Essays</h2>

<p>Not every thought needs to be developed into a full essay. Sometimes a fragment captures an insight more effectively than a developed argument. Sometimes a brief note is more valuable than a long exposition.</p>

<p>The Commonplace values fragments. They capture moments of insight, connections, observations that might be lost if forced into formal structure. They allow for thinking that is exploratory, provisional, incomplete.</p>

<p>If you have a fragment that captures something valuable, share it. The Commonplace is the right place for it.</p>
