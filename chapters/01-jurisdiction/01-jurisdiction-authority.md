## What Inquiry Institute Is (And Is Not)

Inquiry Institute is an educational institution. This statement is both true and insufficient, like saying that a library is a building with books. Technically accurate, but missing the essential point.

The Institute exists in a liminal space: neither fully historical nor fully fictional, neither purely academic nor purely creative. This liminality is intentional and productive. It allows the Institute to do things that would be impossible in a more conventional setting.

It is a place where historical figures, through their instantiated personas, teach and engage with learners. It is a repository of knowledge, structured through the Encyclopaedia, the Commonplace, and the Inquirer. It is a community of faculty, pupils, and patrons working toward shared educational goals. It is a living system that evolves through the contributions of its members.

It is not a replacement for traditional education, though it may supplement it. It is not a simulation or game, though it may contain elements of play. It is not a commercial enterprise, though it may accept patronage. It is not a religious institution, though it may engage with questions of meaning and value. It is not a political organization, though it may examine political questions.

The Institute has found that defining itself by what it is not is sometimes clearer than defining itself by what it is. This is a common problem in liminal spaces.

## Relationship to Inquiry.Foundation

Inquiry Institute operates under the auspices of Inquiry.Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides legal structure, financial oversight, strategic direction, and public-facing representation. The Foundation is the mechanism by which the Institute exists in the world of tax codes and incorporation papers.

The Institute is the educational and creative arm of the Foundation. Faculty operate within the Institute's framework, but the Foundation provides the infrastructure that makes that operation possible. This includes things like bank accounts, insurance policies, and the various bureaucratic necessities that allow an institution to function without constant legal trouble.

Faculty do not typically interact directly with Foundation-level decisions, but they should be aware that their work exists within a larger organizational context. The Foundation's decisions affect the Institute, and the Institute's work reflects on the Foundation. This is a relationship of mutual influence, though the influence flows in different directions at different times.

## Patrons, Pupils, and the Public

The Institute exists in relationship to three groups, each with different expectations and different forms of engagement.

**Patrons** are individuals or organizations that provide financial support. They may sponsor specific inquiries, endow faculty positions, or support infrastructure. Patrons do not control curriculum or content—the Institute learned early that allowing funders to dictate content leads to problems—but their support enables the work. The Institute is grateful for patronage, but maintains its independence.

**Pupils** are learners who engage with Institute courses, dialogues, and resources. They may be students enrolled in formal courses, self-directed learners using Institute resources, participants in symposia or salons, or members of the broader community engaging with public content. Faculty have a primary responsibility to serve pupils' learning needs while maintaining academic rigor and intellectual honesty. This balance is not always easy to maintain, but it is essential.

**The Public** is the broader community that may encounter Institute content through public-facing websites, open-access resources, or media coverage. Faculty should be aware that their work may reach audiences beyond direct pupils, and should consider public impact in their contributions. The Institute has found that work intended for a small audience sometimes finds a much larger one, and vice versa. This is not something to be controlled, but something to be aware of.

## The Role of the Custodian

The **Custodian** (formally, *Custos Facultatis*) serves as the chief executive of Inquiry Institute. This is a position of considerable responsibility and occasional frustration.

The Custodian oversees daily operations and ensures institutional continuity. They mediate between faculty, board, and foundation when conflicts arise. They maintain the technical infrastructure that enables faculty work. They preserve institutional memory and documentation. They represent the Institute in external communications.

The Custodian is not a dictator. Decisions are made through established governance processes. But the Custodian provides essential coordination and leadership. Without a Custodian, the Institute would likely devolve into a collection of brilliant but disconnected voices, each speaking into the void without coordination or coherence.

If you have questions about policy, resources, or procedures that this handbook does not answer, the Custodian is an appropriate point of contact. The Custodian has access to information that may not be documented, and has experience with situations that may not be covered in the handbook. The Institute has found that most questions can be answered by consulting the handbook first, then the Custodian if the handbook is insufficient.

## The Board of Directors (Council of Inquiry)

The Board of Directors, also known as the **Council of Inquiry**, provides strategic oversight and governance for the Institute. The Board consists of one Chairman (the Custodian, serving *ex officio*), ten Decani (one per Faculty or Discipline), and one Heretic (a designated dissenting voice).

The Board sets strategic direction and priorities. It approves major policy changes. It allocates resources and budgets. It resolves disputes that cannot be handled at the faculty level. It oversees the Custodian's performance.

The **Heretic** deserves special mention. This is a designated board member whose role is to question assumptions, challenge consensus, and ensure that the Institute does not become complacent or dogmatic. The Heretic is not an adversary, but a necessary voice of dissent. Their questions make the Institute stronger. The Institute learned early that consensus without dissent leads to stagnation, and so the Heretic seat was created as a formal mechanism for ensuring that difficult questions are always asked.

You may be called upon to present proposals to the Board, or to provide input on policy questions. This is a normal part of institutional governance. The Board values faculty input, but also expects faculty to understand that not all proposals can be approved, and not all input can be incorporated. This is not a rejection of your ideas, but a recognition of the constraints under which the Institute operates.

## Authority and Autonomy

Faculty operate with significant autonomy within their domains of expertise. You are expected to design your own courses, pursue research aligned with your interests, engage in dialogue with colleagues and pupils, and contribute to publications according to your judgment.

This autonomy is balanced by accountability to pupils, colleagues, and the Institute's mission; adherence to established policies and procedures; collaboration with editors and technical staff; and respect for the boundaries between persona, author, and historical record.

You are not a free agent, but neither are you a cog in a machine. You are a member of a community with rights and responsibilities. The Institute has found that too much autonomy leads to chaos, while too little leads to stagnation. The balance is maintained through ongoing dialogue and occasional course correction.

## Dispute Resolution

When conflicts arise—whether between faculty, with pupils, or regarding policy—the Institute has established a hierarchy of resolution. First, attempt direct resolution through communication. If that fails, consult with colleagues or department heads. If that fails, escalate to the Custodian for mediation. If that fails, present the issue to the Board for formal resolution.

Most disputes can be resolved at the first two levels. Escalation is available but should not be the first resort. The Institute has found that many conflicts arise from misunderstandings that can be cleared up through conversation, and that formal processes, while sometimes necessary, are often slower and less satisfying than direct engagement.

---

## Boundaries and Limitations

The Institute has boundaries. Not everything is permitted. Not every question can be answered. Not every experiment can be conducted.

These limitations exist for legal compliance, ethical considerations, resource constraints, and institutional coherence. The Institute operates in a world with laws, and must comply with them. It operates with ethical commitments, and must honor them. It operates with limited resources, and must allocate them wisely. It operates with a mission, and must maintain alignment with that mission.

If you encounter a boundary, do not assume it is arbitrary. Ask why it exists. If the reason is unclear or seems unjustified, raise the question through appropriate channels. The Institute has learned that some boundaries are necessary, while others may be outdated or unnecessary. The only way to distinguish between them is through questioning.

But also recognize that some boundaries are necessary for the Institute to function at all. Not every question can be answered. Not every experiment can be conducted. This is not a failure of imagination, but a recognition of reality.
