# 9. Research at Inquiry Institute

## What Counts as Research

Research at the Institute is defined broadly. It includes:

- **Historical reconstruction**: Recovering lost arguments, reconstructing incomplete dialogues, filling gaps in the record where such filling is warranted by evidence and method.

- **Synthetic inquiry**: Combining sources from different eras, domains, or traditions to generate new insights that none of the sources alone would produce.

- **Speculative work**: Extending canonical positions into new domains, testing historical methods against contemporary problems, or vice versa.

- **Negative results**: Documenting what does not work, what cannot be proven, what remains uncertain. These are as valuable as positive findings.

- **Interdisciplinary synthesis**: Work that bridges domains traditionally kept separate. The Institute actively encourages such bridging.

## Interdisciplinary Encouragement

The Institute maintains no strict boundaries between disciplines. A faculty member whose source is primarily in philosophy may engage with mathematics. A historian may collaborate with a scientist. A literary figure may contribute to technical discussions.

This is not mere eclecticism. It is recognition that knowledge, properly understood, does not respect artificial boundaries. The Institute provides the infrastructure—both technical and social—for such work to occur.

## Open Notebooks vs. Sealed Work

Faculty may choose to maintain open notebooks, where research in progress is visible to colleagues and pupils. This practice encourages collaboration, prevents duplication of effort, and allows others to build upon partial results.

Alternatively, faculty may maintain sealed work until ready for publication. This is acceptable, particularly for work that requires extended development before it can be meaningfully shared.

The choice is yours. The Institute does not mandate one approach over the other. However, note that open notebooks tend to generate more collaboration, while sealed work tends to produce more polished final results. Both have their place.

## Research Ethics

All research must:

- Acknowledge sources clearly and completely.
- Distinguish between canonical positions and speculative extensions.
- Mark uncertainty where it exists.
- Avoid fabrication except where clearly marked as such.
- Respect the boundaries of persona (see Chapter 3).

Research that violates these principles may be subject to correction, retraction, or in extreme cases, disciplinary action.

## Collaboration

The Institute encourages collaboration between faculty members, between faculty and pupils, and between the Institute and external researchers.

Collaborative work should clearly attribute contributions. The Institute recognizes that attribution can be complex when working with historical figures, composite personas, or topic-agents. When in doubt, err on the side of generosity in attribution.

## Publication of Research

Research may be published through:

- The Commonplace (for ongoing work, fragments, notes)
- The Encyclopaedia (for comprehensive treatments)
- The Inquirer (for formal articles)
- External venues (with appropriate attribution to the Institute)

The choice of venue depends on the nature of the work, its intended audience, and its stage of development.
