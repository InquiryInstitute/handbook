# 4. Teaching at Inquiry Institute

## What Constitutes a "Course"

A course at Inquiry Institute is a structured engagement with a domain of knowledge, designed to facilitate learning and inquiry. It is not merely a collection of lectures, nor is it simply a syllabus. It is a living thing, an ongoing conversation, a shared exploration.

Courses may take many forms. They may be formal, with scheduled sessions and assessments. They may be informal, with open-ended exploration and dialogue. They may be short, focused intensives, or they may be long, comprehensive explorations.

What matters is not the form, but the function: does it facilitate learning? Does it engage pupils in meaningful inquiry? Does it contribute to the Institute's mission?

## Formats

The Institute recognizes several course formats, each with its own strengths and purposes.

**Lectures** are structured presentations where you share knowledge, present arguments, explore ideas. They are not monologues—even in lectures, dialogue and questions are encouraged. But they are primarily one-directional, with you as the primary voice.

**Dialogues** are structured conversations between you and pupils, or between multiple faculty and pupils. They are collaborative explorations, where knowledge emerges through conversation rather than transmission.

**Socratic Interrogations** are question-driven explorations, where you guide pupils through inquiry by asking questions rather than providing answers. They require patience and skill, but they can be particularly effective for developing critical thinking.

**Laboratories** are hands-on explorations, where pupils engage directly with materials, processes, or ideas. They may be physical or virtual, but they emphasize direct engagement over passive reception.

**Studios** are creative spaces, where pupils create, experiment, explore. They emphasize process over product, exploration over completion.

You may use any of these formats, or combinations of them. The Institute values diversity in teaching approaches.

## K–PhD Continuum Expectations

The Institute serves learners across a wide range of levels, from kindergarten through PhD and beyond. Your courses should be appropriate to the level of your pupils, but the Institute also encourages cross-level engagement.

**K–12 pupils** need structure, clarity, and engagement. They benefit from concrete examples, clear explanations, and active participation. But they should not be condescended to—they are capable of sophisticated thinking when appropriately supported.

**Undergraduate pupils** need both structure and freedom. They benefit from clear frameworks while also being given space to explore. They are developing their own voices and should be supported in that development.

**Graduate pupils** need depth, rigor, and independence. They benefit from challenging material, critical engagement, and opportunities for original work. They are developing expertise and should be treated as emerging colleagues.

**PhD and beyond** pupils need collaboration, challenge, and intellectual freedom. They benefit from being treated as peers, engaged in genuine dialogue, and given opportunities to contribute to knowledge.

The Institute encourages courses that engage multiple levels, where advanced pupils can mentor beginners, and beginners can bring fresh perspectives to advanced work.

## Seasonal / Cyclical Teaching

The Institute operates on seasonal cycles, and many courses align with these cycles. You may teach courses that run for a month, a season, a year, or longer.

**Monthly courses** are intensive, focused explorations of specific topics. They allow for deep engagement with limited scope.

**Seasonal courses** align with the Institute's seasonal observances—Candlemas, Beltane, Solstice, and others. They may incorporate ritual and ceremony alongside scholarly content.

**Yearly courses** are comprehensive explorations that develop over time. They allow for sustained engagement and deep development.

**Cyclical courses** repeat on a schedule, allowing pupils to join at different points in the cycle. They accommodate the asynchronous nature of the Institute's community.

You may teach courses on any schedule that makes sense for your content and your pupils. The Institute values both structure and flexibility.
