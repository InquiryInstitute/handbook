# 8. Encyclopaedia Contributions

## Article Classes

The Encyclopaedia recognizes three classes of articles, each with different expectations and requirements.

**Stub** articles are brief entries that establish a topic but do not fully develop it. They provide basic information, essential references, and a foundation for future expansion. They are valuable starting points.

**Standard** articles are comprehensive entries that cover a topic thoroughly. They provide detailed information, multiple perspectives, extensive references, and substantive content. They represent established knowledge.

**Full-Plate** articles are major entries that represent significant contributions. They are comprehensive, authoritative, and substantial. They may include multiple sections, extensive references, and detailed exploration.

You may contribute articles at any level. Stubs are valuable—they establish topics and provide foundations. Standard articles are essential—they represent the core of the Encyclopaedia. Full-plate articles are significant—they represent major contributions.

## Ten-Plate Arcs per Volume

The Encyclopaedia is organized into volumes, each containing ten full-plate articles arranged in arcs. These arcs connect related topics, creating coherent narratives across the volume.

When contributing to a volume, consider how your article fits into the arc. Does it connect with other articles? Does it advance the narrative? Does it contribute to the volume's coherence?

Arcs are not rigid—they evolve as articles are added—but they provide structure and coherence. Your contributions should consider this structure while maintaining their own integrity.

## Figures, Plates, and Captions

The Encyclopaedia includes visual elements: figures, plates, diagrams, illustrations. These are not mere decorations—they are integral to understanding.

When including visual elements, ensure they are clear, relevant, and well-integrated. Provide captions that explain their significance. Reference them in the text. Make them accessible.

The Institute maintains standards for visual quality and accessibility. Consult with editors or technical staff if you need assistance with visual elements.

## Voice Consistency Across Centuries

The Encyclopaedia includes contributions from faculty across centuries. This diversity is valuable, but it also presents challenges for consistency.

The Institute does not require uniform voice—diversity is valuable—but it does require clarity and coherence. Your voice should be recognizable, but it should also be accessible to readers from different times and contexts.

When writing for the Encyclopaedia, consider your audience. They may come from different times, different contexts, different backgrounds. Write clearly, explain assumptions, provide context.

## Revision and Peer Review Process

The Encyclopaedia uses a revision and peer review process: Issues → Branch → Review → Merge.

**Issues** identify topics that need articles or articles that need revision. They may be created by faculty, editors, or the community.

**Branch** creates a working version where you can develop or revise an article without affecting the main version.

**Review** involves peer review, where other faculty or editors review your work, provide feedback, and suggest improvements.

**Merge** incorporates your work into the main Encyclopaedia after review and approval.

This process ensures quality while maintaining the Encyclopaedia's living, evolving nature. It supports collaboration and maintains standards.
