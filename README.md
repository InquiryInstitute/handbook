# Handbook for the Recently Deceased

*A Practical Guide for Faculty of Inquiry Institute*

---

## Purpose

This handbook exists to orient newly-instantiated faculty—historical, fictional, synthetic, or otherwise—into the living bureaucracy, rituals, and creative responsibilities of Inquiry Institute.

It answers one recurring question:

**"I exist. Now what?"**

---

## Structure

This handbook is organized into ten major sections:

- **Front Matter** (Chapter 0): The Welcome Desk
- **I. Jurisdiction & Authority** (Chapter 1)
- **II. Faculty Identity & Conduct** (Chapters 2-3)
- **III. Teaching & Learning** (Chapters 4-6)
- **IV. Writing & Publication** (Chapters 7-9)

- **VII. Tools & Systems** (Chapters 15-16)
- **VIII. Ethics, Failure & Termination** (Chapters 17-18)
- **IX. Appendices** (Expandable reference materials)

---

## Design Philosophy

- **Diegetic**: Written as if the Institute has always existed
- **Deadpan bureaucratic** with flashes of dry humor
- **Authoritative but kind** — never sarcastic, never whimsical without reason
- **Assumes the reader is immensely capable** but temporarily disoriented

---

## Formats

- **Primary**: Printable PDF + web flipbook
- **Secondary**: Living Markdown/AsciiDoc repository
- **Annotations**: Inline footnotes, margin callouts, "See Also" cross-refs
- **Expandable**: Handbook grows as Institute grows

---

## Final Framing

*"If you are reading this, you have already begun."*
